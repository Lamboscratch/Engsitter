## Who am I?

Before introducing myself, I want to extend a warm welcome to anyone browsing these pages. I'm an **IT engineer** with a master's degree specializing
in networking and cybersecurity. Currently, I work for a defense company based in Rome, Italy. My passion for computer science began during adolescence:
I spent hours in front of the computer and was particularly **drawn to the world of ethical hacking**. Over time, my thirst for knowledge led me to delve
deeper into this field. But enough chit-chat. Let's get to the point and talk about this project.

## What is engsitter.com?

Great question. I think the best way to explain it is with these two words: **Frankenstein's monster**. What I mean is that the mix of
posts / articles / tutorials / lessons you'll read aims primarily to disseminate knowledge about Networking and Cybersecurity. The intention is to
explain topics, even complex ones, in a clear and understandable way for everyone.

### The genesis of the idea

After my first year of work, I feel the need to start a parallel path. I spent a lot of time thinking about what project to start, and in the end,
I understood the path to take. Considering that I've always received excellent feedback on my ability to explain a topic simply and effectively,
I chose **writing technical content**. And what better way to do it than to **start a blog** to share my knowledge? Said and done. About three months ago,
I created a repository on GitHub, and here we are. Engistter is finally online.

### The eternal doubt about the project's name

I spent hours, days, weeks thinking about what name to give this strange creature 😅. I was looking for a funny pun that would summarize the nature the
site's nature. And then came the insight:

-   **Eng** + **sitter**

Just as a babysitter takes care of children, Engsitter wants to provide learning assistance to every engineer placed in this field and accompany them
on the journey of acquiring new knowledge.

## The main goal

The main goal is to **spread knowledge in the field of networking and cybersecurity** in an easy and accessible way for everyone. New content will be
regularly published in these areas. As we'll see later, the site is divided into sections to facilitate navigation through posts related to the topic of
interest. You'll find, for example, useful content for preparing for certification but also many others, supporting the understanding of various areas of
computer science.

In any case, when I decided to start this journey, I had many doubts but also a robust certainty: **to make the site's content available for free to
everyone**. So I started thinking about the most sustainable way to generate income without anyone having to spend a dime. And that's why advertisements
will soon be placed on the site. It seemed like the best choice to make the content accessible and support the project.

### Topics covered

We'll talk about everything: from **preparing for certifications** to a detailed understanding of everything that makes **network device interconnection
and security** possible. I decided to start with posts related to preparation for [CCNA][] and [CEH][] certifications and then move on to increasingly
complex topics.

## How to navigate within the site

I've tried to make the site as easy to navigate as possible. The core of the contents is concentrated at the [/posts][] path where all the posts are
located and divided into sections. By clicking on a generic topic, you'll see a list of posts sorted from oldest to newest because the future contents
will be posted sequentially following a logical reference. With the magnifying glass located at the top right of the viewport, you can search the entire site
to find exactly what you're looking for. Finally, at the [/resources][] path, you'll find **many useful resources to reinforce the concepts covered**.

I just want to wish you a pleasant stay. See you soon! 👋
