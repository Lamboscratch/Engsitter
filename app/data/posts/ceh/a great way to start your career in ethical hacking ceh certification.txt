## Why Choose the CEH?

The main reason I chose to start discussing the [CEH][] is undoubtedly the **completeness of the certification** in the
field of ethical hacking, compared to alternatives. It covers all the aspects of ethical hacking that an intermediate
individual should know. Additionally, the EC-Council - the body that issues this certification - is **accredited by the
American National Standards Institute** ([ANSI][]). This makes the certification globally recognized and ideal for aiming
for significant positions in this field.

## What the Certification Covers

To obtain the certification, you need to start with a **solid foundation of networking knowledge**. Without this, it
would be impossible to delve into ethical hacking topics since almost all the attacks presented are carried out over the
network. The first real concept we will address concerns the **basic notions of security**, which include a series of
concepts to understand what it means to design a security architecture. Then, we will talk about the three fundamental
steps to gather as much information as possible about the target system of an attack. These are: **footprinting, scanning,
and enumeration**. Next, we will cover classic attack techniques, focusing on **post-exploitation** practices. After
consolidating this knowledge, we will introduce the **types of malware** and their analysis and creation. In every ethical
hacker's arsenal, **network sniffing skills** are indispensable. That's why we will study the main tools that allow such
operations. At this point, we will talk about how most attacks are executed today, that is, by exploiting **social
engineering** techniques. To close the loop on the main attack techniques, we will also cover **wireless security**,
studying how to hack communications that travel over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Finally, we will thoroughly study the main
**encryption protocols** and take a look at the most popular buzzwords today, namely **Cloud Computing and the Internet
of Things**.

## How to Best Prepare for the Certification

For almost all the topics we will cover, it is important to do **practical exercises** to acquire the skills necessary
to pass the certification. We will make extensive use of tools and operating systems designed to facilitate the work of
those in this field. We will extensively use **[Kali Linux][Kali]**, an open-source distribution of the famous Linux that
gathers a series of **tools to support penetration testing activities**. Additionally, in the [/resources][res] section,
you will be able to consult and download material that I will make available to consolidate the knowledge gained during
the study.

In the next post, we will talk about an introduction to ethical hacking. I wish you a pleasant stay on engsitter.com!
