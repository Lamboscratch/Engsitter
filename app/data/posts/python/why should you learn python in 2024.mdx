## Introduction to the language

Python is a **general-purpose programming language**. Its features make it ideal for a wide range of use. First and
foremost, it is **cross-platform**. We can run Python scripts on the most popular operating systems, such as Windows,
MacOS, and all Linux distributions. Secondly, it has a **vary rich standard library**. Many of the operations a
programmer performs daily are already natively provided by the language.

One of the strengths of this language is **its simplicity**. It takes just a few days to get familiar with the
language and create the first scripts to run. Although the language is **object-oriented**, its syntax is simpler
than more classical Java or C++. Additionally, Python provides a **very high level of abstraction**, making it
suitable for newcomers to the programming world.

The downside is that Python, being an **interpreted language**, offers lower performance compared to compiled
languages. Fortunately, for applications in networking and cybersecurity, this is not a significant obstacle. With
that in mind, let's move on to see which aspects of the language we will focus on and how they can help enhance
your technical skills.

## The aspects of Python that we will focus on

We will begin our study of Python with a more in-depth introduction, followed by getting familiar with
**the native interpreter** that will allow us to issue commands from the terminal quickly and easily. Right after
that, we will dive into the **language syntax** and explore how Python supports object-oriented programming. After
consolidating these concepts, we will learn about **type annotations** in Python, how it handles **exceptions**,
and the difference between **modules and packages**. We will take a look at the main modules that characterize
Python's **standard library**, analyze **string handling**, define **regular expressions**, and perform **numerical
and file operations**. We will then study more advanced concepts such as **concurrency management** (threads and
processes) and understand how to **test, debug, and optimize code written in Python**. An important part of the
content will focus on Python applications in **networking and web programming**. Finally, we will understand how
to **extend the language's functionality** and apply Python in the context of ethical hacking by studying and
writing **scripts for penetration testing operations**.

## The strength of Python is its versatility

Python is widely used. As reported by [TIOBE][], it is **the most popular programming language at the moment**.
But what makes it so special? I believe one of the best answers to this question is that Python is suitable for
any context. With Python, you can create **automation scripts** very easily to make daily or periodic actions
much simpler. The use cases don't stop there. Over the years, **web programming frameworks** have become very
popular, and among them, [Flask][] and [Django][] certainly stand out. Not to mention the surge it has experienced
with the explosion of AI... Among the most popular libraries for **machine learning**, we certainly find
[TensorFlow][], [Keras][], [PyTorch][], and [Scikit-Learn][]. Last but not least, it is impossible not to mention
**the use of Python for ethical hacking**. We can see this by performing a [search on GitHub][GH_H] with the
keyword _hacking_.

As you can see in the screenshot, the search returns about 140k repositories. [Filtering the results][GH_H_P]
for the Python language, we quickly realize that out of the original 140k repositories, **20.6k of them are related
to Python**.

I think it's clear by now that studying Python in 2024 can open many doors and job opportunities. Stay tuned
because a ton of content is coming. See you soon!
