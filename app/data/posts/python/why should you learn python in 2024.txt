## Introduction to the Language

Python is a **general-purpose programming language**. Its features make it ideal for many areas of use. Firstly,
it is **cross-platform**. We can run Python scripts on the most popular operating systems, such as Windows, MacOS,
and various Linux distributions. Secondly, it has a **rich standard library**. Many of the operations a programmer
performs daily are already natively provided by the language.

One of the strengths of this language is **its simplicity**. It takes just a few days to get familiar with the
language and create the first scripts to run. Although the language is **object-oriented**, its syntax is simpler
than more traditional languages like Java or C++. Moreover, Python provides a **high level of abstraction**, making
it suitable for newcomers to the programming world.

The downside is that Python, being an **interpreted language**, offers lower performance compared to compiled
languages. Fortunately, for applications in networking and cybersecurity, this does not pose a hurdle. With this
in mind, let's look at the aspects of the language we will focus on and how they can help enhance your technical
skills.

## The Aspects of Python We Will Focus On

We will start studying Python with a more in-depth introduction, then move on to getting familiar with the
**native interpreter**, which will allow us to issue commands from the terminal easily and quickly. Right after
that, we will dive into the **language syntax** and study how Python supports object-oriented programming. After
consolidating these concepts, we will see what **type annotations** are in Python, how it handles **exceptions**,
and the difference between **modules and packages**. We will take a look at the main modules that characterize
Python's **standard library**, analyze **string handling**, the definition of **regular expressions**, **numerical
and file operations**. We will then study more advanced concepts such as **concurrency management** (threads and
processes) and understand how to **test, debug, and optimize code written in Python**. An important part of the
content will focus on Python applications in **networking and web programming**. Finally, we will understand how
to **extend the language's functionality** and apply Python to ethical hacking, studying and writing **scripts
for penetration testing operations**.

## The Strength of Python is Its Versatility

Python is widespread. As reported by [TIOBE][], it is **the most popular programming language at the moment**.
But what makes it so special? I believe one of the best answers to this question is that Python is suitable for
any context. With Python, you can create **automation scripts** very easily to make daily or periodic actions
much simpler. The use cases don't stop there. Over the years, **web programming frameworks** have become very
popular; among these, [Flask][] and [Django][] are definitely worth mentioning. Not to mention the surge it has
had with the explosion of AI. Among the most famous libraries for **machine learning**, we certainly find
[TensorFlow][], [Keras][], [PyTorch][], and [Scikit-Learn][]. Last but not least, Python's use for **ethical
hacking** cannot be overlooked. We have proof of this by conducting a [search on GitHub][GH_H] with the
keyword _hacking_.

![GitHub search for the keyword "hacking"](/images/python/why-should-you-learn-python-in-2024/Github-search-hacking.png)

As you can see in the screenshot, the search returns about 140k repositories. [Filtering the results][GH_H_P]
for the Python language, we immediately realize that, of the original 140k repositories, **20.6k of these pertain
to Python**.

I think it's clear by now that studying Python in 2024 can open many doors and job opportunities. Stay tuned
because a lot of content is coming soon. See you soon!
