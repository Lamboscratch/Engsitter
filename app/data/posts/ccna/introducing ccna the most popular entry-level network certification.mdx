## What is CCNA?

CCNA 200-301 is the **entry-level networking certification from [Cisco][]**. The acronym stands
for Cisco Certified Network Associate. It forms the basis for all other certifications offered
by Cisco. The skills that are tested on the exam cover the **ability to analyze and predict the
operation of a network** and **the ability to configure Cisco devices** to properly connect multiple
network nodes.

## Why is CCNA so popular?

The answer is simple: **Cisco has an extraordinarily large market share**. Cisco's [switches][],
[routers][] and [firewalls][] are everywhere. Knowing how these devices work, the performance
characteristics, and the syntax of the proprietary CLI ensures that you can confidently juggle
most circumstances. In addition, **the CCNA is a globally recognized certification**. Many rookie
professionals become certified to increase their chances of getting a great job right away.

## Topics covered in the certification

After discussing the reasons for getting certified, let's review the topics you need to know
to join the Cisco family.

First of all, we will learn about the foundations of networking as we use it today. We will
start by studying the **TCP/IP stack and the ISO/OSI model**. Immediately after, we will address
the concepts of **LAN, MAN, and WAN**. The main focus will be on local networks using wired
technologies, namely **Ethernet**, and wireless. We will extend this concept by talking about
**virtual LAN** and protocols for managing loops within the network. We will then move on to
the core of networking, discussing **addressing and routing in networks**. This will involve
studying the protocols that enable packet routing, with particular emphasis on **OSPF**. The
main concepts covered for IPv4 will be revisited and elaborated for **IPv6**. We will then
introduce the concept of **Access Control Lists** and see how we can filter packets and prevent
them from being forwarded by a router. Finally, we will discuss some **security services** and
conclude the study by analyzing **network architectures and some aspects of automation**.

## How to approach the study of networking

Theory alone is never enough. This argument applies even more so in this context since, during
the exam, you are called upon to demonstrate the practical knowledge you have acquired by using
CLI commands. For each new topic, it is necessary to practice thoroughly, issuing commands on
network devices to master the concept. For this reason, we will use **[Cisco Packet Tracer][CPT]**
to interconnect multiple network nodes in a simulated environment. This software allows you to
practice on the most common Cisco network devices and access the CLI of each of them in order
to configure them.

Let's waste no more time and dive into the study of networking, starting with an introduction
of computer networks.
