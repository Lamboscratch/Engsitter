## What is CCNA?

The CCNA 200-301 is Cisco's entry-level networking certification. The acronym stands for Cisco
Certified Network Associate. It serves as the foundation for all other Cisco certifications.
The skills tested in the exam include the ability to analyze and predict network functioning
and configure Cisco devices to effectively communicate between network nodes.

## Why is CCNA So Popular?

The answer is simple: **Cisco holds an extraordinarily large market share**. Cisco's
[switches][], [routers][], and [firewalls][] are everywhere. Understanding the operation of
these devices, their performance characteristics, and the syntax of the proprietary CLI
ensures confidence in most circumstances.

## Topics Covered in the Certification

After discussing the reasons for getting certified, let's review the topics you need to know
to join the Cisco family.

### Introduction to Networking

This introductory part covers studying the TCP/IP stack by comparing it to the OSI model. It
also introduces LAN and WAN concepts, presenting the basic operation of routing.

### Ethernet LANs

After getting an overview of local area networks, we delve into studying the command-line
interface for switch configuration and remote management.

### Understanding VLANs

VLANs are a tool to segment the network and manage different traffic flows. Special emphasis
should be placed on VLAN trunking and STP.

### Addressing and Routing in IPv4

Key IPv4 addressing concepts are presented, along with methods to determine IP address subnet
membership. After consolidating these concepts, we move on to routing and troubleshooting.

### Routing Protocols

An overview of major routing protocols is provided, with particular emphasis on OSPF.

### IPv6

IPv6 represents the evolution of IPv4. Learn how to configure a Cisco appliance to operate
with IPv6.

### Wireless LANs

The 802.11 protocol allows for the creation of a wireless local area network. By nature, such
a network faces security challenges. Cisco devices enable securing and managing such a network.

### Access Control Lists

IP packet filtering is achieved through the adoption of Access Control Lists. Named and
numbered ACL concepts are explained.

### Network Device Security

Managing network device security is crucial to mitigate major cyberattacks. Special emphasis
is placed on DHCP snooping and ARP inspection.

### Advanced IP Topics

An overview is provided of support services for network device configuration, including Syslog,
NTP, CDP, LLDP, NAT, QoS, FHRP, SNMP, TFTP, and FTP.

### Network Architectures and Automation

Understanding LAN, WAN, and Cloud architectures helps evaluate the pros and cons of one design
approach over another. Network automation solutions are becoming more prevalent in the enterprise world. Cisco offers a proprietary solution called SDA (Software-Defined Network) that fulfills this task.

## Approaching Networking Study

Theory alone is not enough. This holds especially true in this context, as during the exam,
practical knowledge acquired through study using command-line commands is tested. For each
new topic, thorough practice is required by issuing commands on network devices to master the
concept.
